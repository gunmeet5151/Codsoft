# TASK 1: TIC-TAC-TOE AI:
Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable. This project will help you understand game theory and basic search algorithms.
## SOLUTION 
Tic-Tac-Toe game with a Tkinter GUI and AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm. Play against the AI or with a friend. The AI calculates optimal moves to ensure challenging gameplay tictactoe.py file contains all the code for game implementation. tictactoeHome.py file contains the home page of a game that you see after running the file that will show you the play and exit buttons.
# TASK 2: CHATBOT:
Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.
## SOLUTION
Interact with an AI-powered chatbot through a user-friendly graphical interface. Explore features such as web searches, YouTube video lookup, music playback, and engaging conversations. Built using Python and libraries like tkinter, webbrowser, PIL, and pywhatkit.
